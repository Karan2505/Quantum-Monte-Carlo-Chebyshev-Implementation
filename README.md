# Quantum-Monte-Carlo-Chebyshev-Implementation
This project uses a quantum circuit to approximate a 2D target function (a bivariate Gaussian) using a multivariate Chebyshev series and block encoding techniques. This quantum representation enables further quantum processing and analysis of the function.
